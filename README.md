## **Framework selection**
The chosen tool is Playwright because it is a robust framework, ideal for scaling and adding more tests over time. It supports cross-browser testing and device emulation, enabling thorough testing across different environments. Playwright has a strong community, detailed documentation, and modern features that simplify automation tasks. Additionally, as it is the tool I have been using recently, it aligns with my expertise, making it easier and more efficient for me to implement.
